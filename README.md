PHPFacile! Openstreetmap
==================

This service basically retrieves data from the Openstreetmap (OSM) data thanks to the Overpass API.

This project is not related to the Openstreetmap project team.
Not sure whether I can keep this library name so take care if you want to use it, its name may change in the future.
